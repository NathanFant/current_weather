# ðŸ“˜ User Stories â€” Current Weather MVP

---

### 1. As a user, I want to see the current weather in my location so I can plan my day.

- The app automatically fetches weather based on my coordinates (default is Little Rock if not available).
- I can view temperature, humidity, and weather description.

---

### 2. As a user, I want to manually enter a location so I can check the weather somewhere else.

- I can enter latitude and longitude to get the forecast for a different place.
- Useful when traveling or planning ahead.

---

### 3. As a user, I want the appâ€™s background to reflect the weather so I get a visual sense of the day ahead.

- If itâ€™s cloudy, the background looks overcast; if itâ€™s raining, I see rain imagery.
- This gives the app a more immersive and helpful feel than a plain background.

---

### 4. As a user, I want the app to have a clean and responsive design so it feels intuitive and simple to use.

- The layout adjusts well on desktop and mobile.
- The styling is minimal but pleasant.
